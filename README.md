# Dreamlike Days
Just a project for me to learn about React and Redux.

##Installation
```
npm install
```
You'll need the babel CLI tools if you don't already have them:
```
$ npm install --global babel
```

##Run
```
gulp build
npm start
```

You'll also need an API that serves entries as JSON. The current implementation
is in flask, but needs more cleaning up before it will be published on Github.
